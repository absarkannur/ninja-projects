                            <p>Monitoring the safety of medicines involves a range of activities aimed at identifying, evaluating, understanding, and mitigating potential adverse effects or other drug-related issues. This process includes reviewing and analyzing reports of suspected adverse reactions, scientific literature, epidemiological studies, and findings from additional clinical trials.</p>
                            <p>Ozon consistently evaluates new and emerging safety data as it becomes available and takes regulatory action when necessary. Beyond enhancing the safety profiles of existing medicines, pharmacovigilance activities expand the understanding of drug safety and contribute to a broader pool of epidemiological data.</p>
                            <p>Pharmacovigilance plays a crucial role in advancing medical knowledge, guiding future research, and supporting product development. Ultimately, any improvements in safety or understanding translate into better patient care.</p>
